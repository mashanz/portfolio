# Open Project Development

Hi There! My name is **`Hanjara Cahya Adhyatma`** This is my public projects portfolio, I have work at various and different kind of projects. From Embedded Hardware to Web Server. I start to have interest in coding since **Elementary Scool** and my first program is desktop calculator build with _VisualBasic_. When attend **Junior High School** I start _my first web_ and when I am **Senior High School** I build my own _PCB_ to create _LED Flip-Flop, simple Trafic Light and Guitar Effect_. After I go to **University** I have interest in _robotic_ and start to build various Robots.

In this repo I collect remaining project data `if there still available` for documentation and education purpose. Here we are!

## Web Online Registration for Schools Club Member 
> [Go to Repo](https://github.com/mashanz/pendaftaran-online-ekskul)

This project from when I still Senior High School (2011). Every years our school have club event that introducting every club activity in school. This event is part of freshman orientation. In this event every club also recruiting possible member candidate. So, we from Computer Club decide to create paperless registration to support Green Environment without waste.

This CMS Build with `HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, PHP, and XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP, Pearl)` Engine. At that time I still use `notepad` or `Notepad++` IDE to edit the code. This project build from scratch without any framework like `ReactJS, VueJS, Code Igniter` etc.

```
Languages               : HTML, CSS, JS, PHP
Technologies/Frameworks : XAMPP, jQuery

## AVR 3D Axis Music Box Instrument
> [Go to Repo](https://github.com/mashanz/AVR-3D-Axis-Music-Box-Instrument)

Midi digital instrumen based on '3D movement'. The instrumen build with `ATmega32` microcontroller and `9 DOF sensor` (Accelero, Gyro, and Magneto). The apearance of this device is like stick and you can play it like air drum. This MIDI device is also preloaded with `16 bit music` like nasional theme `Ibu Kita Kartini` and folk music `Gundul - Gundul Pacul`.

This Device mainly build with `C/C++` with `Arduino Library`. On this repo source code only available. For PCB schematic and wiring you can contact me or reverse engineer with your own.
